# 🔐 Cybersecurity Lab Environment Setup

Creating a virtual lab for safe cybersecurity testing and ethical hacking 
</div>

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on setting up a **virtual cybersecurity and penetration-testing laboratory** using VirtualBox and Kali Linux.

---
# 🪜 Lab Setup Procedure

## Step 1. Install 7-Zip

7-Zip was installed to extract the Kali Linux virtual-machine package, which may be distributed as a `.7z` archive.

**Tool:** 7-Zip

---

## Step 2. Install VirtualBox

VirtualBox was installed as the hypervisor.

---

## Step 3. Create the NAT Network

A dedicated NAT Network was created in VirtualBox.

Configuration:
Network Name: NatNetwork
IPv4 Prefix:  10.0.0.0/24
DHCP:         Enabled
IPv6:         Disabled

A **NAT Network** was selected because multiple virtual machines connected to the same NAT Network can communicate with one another while also having outbound network connectivity.

This will allow future attacker and target VMs to communicate within the lab.


---

## Step 4. Import Kali Linux

The Kali Linux virtual machine was downloaded from the official Kali Linux website and imported into VirtualBox.

The VM network adapter was configured as follows:

```text
Adapter 1
Attached to: NAT Network
Network:     NatNetwork
Adapter Type: Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop
```

The VM was allocated:

```text
RAM: 2048 MB
```

A shared folder was also configured for transferring required files between the host operating system and the Kali VM.



---

## Step 5. Configure the Kali Linux Network

The Kali Linux network configuration was checked and configured with a consistent IPv4 address.

Example configuration:

```text
IP Address: 10.0.0.2
Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 10.0.0.1
DNS: 8.8.8.8
```

A consistent IP address makes it easier to document the lab and reference the Kali machine in future exercises.

## Step 6. Create a Clean VM Snapshot

After completing the initial configuration, a VirtualBox snapshot was created.

Example of snapshot :
